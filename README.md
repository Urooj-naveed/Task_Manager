# Task Management System

## Overview
This Task Management System is designed to streamline task assignment, tracking, and management within an organization. The system supports three user roles: General Manager, Department Manager, and Worker. Users can create tasks, assign them to others, edit tasks, and manage their own tasks. This was a class asignment for the coursework software engineering and one of my first programs based on python language. There is a lot of room for improvement from a professional point of view.

## Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up or log in based on their role and department.
Task Assignment: Users can create tasks and assign them to others based on their role and department.
Task Editing: Users can edit task details, including the task name, assignee, and status.
Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks, and department managers can send delete requests.
Task Display: Tasks are displayed with relevant details such as ID, name, status, assigned-to, and delete request status.
Role-based Access: Different user roles have specific functionalities and access permissions.
